            <h2>Go whale watching in Boston, Massachusetts</h2>
            <p>Boston is one of my favourite east coast cities, packed full of history and incredible seafood, thereâ€™s a massive amount to do in the city. If youâ€™re spending a few days on your trip, make sure to head out whale watching, pack in some walking along the Freedom Trail.</p>

            <h2>See the roaring falls of Finger Lakes, New York</h2>
            <p>Last time I visited Finger Lakes was in the midst of a crazy thunderstorm for a night in a tent. It was terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure. Thankfully, thunderstorms are few and far between and the whole area is a breathtaking place to enjoy a few days away from the hustle and bustle of, say, New York City. Make sure to take some time to visit, the roaring, Taughannock Falls and Watkins Glen that is truly one of a kind.</p>

            <h2>Narragansett Bay Narragansett, Rhode Island</h2>
            <p>From here, you'll follow Ocean Road north to the Narragansett Town Beach, where surfers ride vigorous waves year-round and The Towersâ€”all that remain of the Gilded Age Narragansett Pier Casinoâ€”are an enchanting backdrop. Drive Route 1A North, and you'll pass Historic New England's Casey Farm, established in 1750 and still operating and open for tours.</p>
